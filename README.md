# my-portfolio-web-site
Just an example of an angular single-page application using ui-router. My personal portfolio.

# SYNOPSIS
This is a simple project in which I used Angular and some other Angular dependencies like ui-router and angular-ui. For the design I used Bootstrap and JQuery.
For the build process I used Gulp and as package manager I used NPM.
