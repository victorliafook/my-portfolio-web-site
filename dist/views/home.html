        <p>My name is Victor Lia Fook, I am a Software & Web Developer from Brazil, making a living in the beautiful Australia! Please feel free to take a look at this website, and <a ui-sref="app.about">learn more about me</a> as well as my work and passion: Computer Programming!</p>
		<p>The main goal of this website is to serve as a fast portfolio of my skills and work as a programmer. By the way, <a ui-sref="app.contact">I can help you</a> make your web project on a freelance or contract basis.</p>
		<p>However, I also want this to be a place to share some of my experience with the community - Some code, techniques and tips. Sure, I know that there are plenty of specialized blogs and websites that certainly do it better than me but I believe that knowledge is to be shared. So, I hope you enjoy it!</p>
